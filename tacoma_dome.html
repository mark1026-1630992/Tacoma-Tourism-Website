	<p class="text-information">The Tacoma Dome is one of the largest wood domed structures in the world. It is owned and operated by the City of Tacomaâ€™s Venues & Events Department. Flexibility is the key to the success of the Tacoma Dome. With new state of the art telescopic seating and an extensive curtaining system, almost any event is possible. The unique configurations mean the Tacoma Dome can accommodate 1,000 to 21,000 patrons, making it the largest indoor venue in the state of Washington. This landmark has defined Tacoma for over 40 years already and has been engrained into the culture of the city and the region. It is a must see landmark and can provide some great entertainment offerings to complement your trip to Tacoma!</p>

  <h3 class="td-header">History</h3>
    <!-- make this a slide show image? -->
    <p class="text-information">On July 1, 1981 the Tacoma Dome started construction with the aspirations to be a "facility that has the greatest flexibility of any structure of its kind in the world". Taking inspiration from the versatility of the NAU's Skydome, the Tacoma Dome wanted to be an enormous sight to be seen by those living in Tacoma, or those passing by. It took 19.5 months to complete construction of the 152 foot tall and 530 foot staple of the Tacoma area. It was a massive effort that took over 320,000 nails and 260,000 square feet of concrete to form such a enourmous yet sturdy structure that has come to be one of the defining landmarks of the city. The Tacoma Dome was continously in use all the way up to the summer of 2018 in which a 30 million renovations took place to both improve seating and legspace, upgrading and adding restrooms, and increasing concessions in order to futher increase the quality of the venue.
